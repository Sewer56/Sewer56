# Hi, I'm Sewer! üëã

I'm an open source library author by day and a single-player game modder/reverse engineer by night. I began my journey in the world of development in 2012 with the Xperia Play, my first Android device. Since then, my passion for tinkering with both software and hardware has led me down an exciting path, from creating custom ROMs for better performance on hardware-constrained devices to reverse engineering game formats and contributing to a diverse range of open source projects.

You can learn more about my stuff on [Sewer's Index](https://sewer56.dev/Sewer56.Index/).

## My Journey üõ§Ô∏è

My initial inspiration to start programming came in 2015 when I decided to tinker with Sonic Heroes, a game that filled me with nostalgia. The experience of reverse engineering the [Object Placement format](https://info.sonicretro.org/SCHG:Sonic_Heroes/Object_Editing) and learning C# at school led to a hobby that would define a significant part of my life. 

In 2017, I collaborated with [Igor Seabra](https://github.com/IgorSeabra4) to crack open Sonic Heroes, culminating in the release of [Heroes Tweakbox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O3IDXzU5L8). Since then, I've been hopping between different games to aid various modding communities, while also contributing to general open source libraries. I am perhaps best known for my work on [Reloaded-II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II), a next-generation .NET based mod loader.

Currently, I'm working at [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com) as my day job, and in the off time, I continue to release new modifications, patches, and libraries. I also occasionally contribute to other Open Source Projects, including but not limited to [DotNetCorePlugins](https://github.com/natemcmaster/DotNetCorePlugins/pull/164), [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib/pull/416), [SharpGenTools](https://github.com/SharpGenTools/SharpGenTools/pull/222), [il-repack](https://github.com/Alexx999/il-repack/pull/2), [vcdiff](https://github.com/SnowflakePowered/vcdiff/pull/6) and even the [.NET Runtime itself](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/76559). [And more!!]

## My Projects üèóÔ∏è

I have *a lot* of personal projects, with a good variety of different purposes; you can find more information about them on [Sewer's Index](https://sewer56.dev/Sewer56.Index/); a neat visual representation of my stuff.
